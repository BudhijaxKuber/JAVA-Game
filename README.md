# JAVA-Game'

Create an application for the game - Tank Stars using either LibGDX or JavaFX. Using
LibGDX is encouraged because of the following.
● JavaFX is not used much in real-world projects. On the other hand, LibGDX is a game
development framework that provides a lot of support for developing games.
● It might turn out that the UI and other game features might just "look better" when
LibGDX is used. If there is a subjective assessment component, there is a chance that the
project using LibGDX might end up getting slightly higher points than an equivalent
JavaFX project.
We will be implementing the two-player (1 vs 1) game mode where players face off on hilly
terrain, taking turns firing bombs at one another. Players get a limited fuel ration per turn and are
allowed to position themselves for a better shot. They can gain weapon upgrades by random
airdrops, and must shoot at one another until one of their tanks is destroyed.
